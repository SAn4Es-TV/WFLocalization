# Localization base for WEBFISHING
This mod is a base for WEBFISHING translation.
The mod reads files in the language folder, applying lines from there to the game each time the level is loaded (transition animation).
This means that you can write your own localization without writing code.
### Installation:
1. Download and install [GDWeave](https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/p/NotNet/GDWeave/)
2. Download mod from releases page, unzip to _WEBFISHING\GDWeave\Mods_
3. Download localization, unzip to _WEBFISHING\GDWeave\Mods\SAn4Es.LocalizationBase_
4. Launch the game, select the language in the upper left corner and restart the game

### How to translate
1. Download the archive with English language files from the releases page
2. Replace the English text with the text of your language (to see how to translate and which lines, for example, you can download the Russian localization) (Maybe I'll write a normal guide)

This mod may contain errors, bugs, and untranslated moments, if you notice something, please report it on github. 
#### Changes to the mod are welcome, we can make it better!
